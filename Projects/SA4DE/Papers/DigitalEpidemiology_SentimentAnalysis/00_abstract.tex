\begin{abstract}
\noindent The goal of this document is to review the standard sentiment analysis methods and their associated advantages and disadvantages. In the end, this will provide a platform to sensibly implement sentiment analysis algorithms reliably for any domain and application of interest. In route and in particular, we review and provide basic examples of these algorithms along the way, and finally outline how they could be used in epidemiology and assessing the public's health through data mining platforms.

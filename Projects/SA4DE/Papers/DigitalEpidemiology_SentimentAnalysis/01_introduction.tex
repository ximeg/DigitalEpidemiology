The ability to understand or infer emotion signatures from an individual's information: text, speech, pictures, art works has always generated healthy amounts of engineering and scientific interest. Now, in the current information age where social-media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter attract and interconnect individuals from around the world, understanding these emotion characteristics have become critical. Indeed, these social media platforms offer individuals the ability to express and disseminate their self expression; instantaneously highlighting their personalities to the world. Hence, social media platforms offer potentially rich digital representations of humanity at large. Because of the large amounts personality representations, anthropologist, psychologist, and sociologist might be able to glean a unique understanding of human nature through automated belief and opinion mining and subsequent analysis. Principally, this automated emotion analysis is possible because of \textit{sentiment analysis}. As a result, it has become increasingly common practice to unleash sentiment analysis methods for the prediction of election outcomes, commerce and marketing, user satisfaction, and general behavioral analysis online.
